# CCModLoader

Welcome! You probably found this through the [**Sky Studs Server**](https://discord.com/invite/5JbZ9vCEXm).  
This is a simple, user-friendly ModLoader for [**Cube Combination**](https://www.roblox.com/games/9798463281/Boss-Respawning-Cube-Combination), designed to make adding new content as easy as dragging a file (most cc players can't script shit!).

### Currently Supported:
```
- Cubes  
- Craftings  
- Entities  
- Effects  
- Assets  
```

All of these are automatically imported into the game's files for easy use.
Creating your own mod is straightforward — just place your content into the provided **Template**, and that's it! You've got yourself a fun and functional mod.
Most mods won’t even require a single line of Lua code. So go ahead — experiment, create, and enjoy!
